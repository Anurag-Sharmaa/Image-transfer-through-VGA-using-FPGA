# Image-transfer-through-VGA-using-FPGA
I have taken two images suppose one Ben image and other image on which suppose inversion operation is performed, so after perfroming the operation I have converted those output files (original BEn image and inverted image in .txt file and thne used in this code), 
those files are stored in projectname.srcs/sources_1/new/
then after doing that, you are good to run the design files in veriog, using vivado design suite.
Follow the documentation file of nexys 4 DDR, as all this code is run on that board , it has detailed description of use of VGA cable with monitor and its detils and working in hardware
